At the beggining, a random sample of the archive from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam are showed. In total there are more than 1.230.000 pieces of art reachable through their APIs and databases.

The results are nested in 5 levels:
1 Database to which they belong
2 Year of creation
3 Geographical origin

5 Single piece

In the last level, you can open a new tab and get full info of the piece.
